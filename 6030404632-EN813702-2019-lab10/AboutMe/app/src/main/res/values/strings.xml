    <string name="bio">If you’re looking for the Instagram bio examples, Queen Latifah’s formula is worth stealing.  The best Instagram bios tend to have a self-description. Things to consider adding: your job title(s) and the company you own or work for. For example, check out Queen Latifah’s Instagram bio. In the first line of her cool bio she writes, “Actor/Rapper/Singer/Producer.” When people visit her fanpage, they’ll learn that she is more than just an actor and may check out her other gigs to learn more about her. Plus, that little blue tick shows up on her page and people will immediately understand that she’s famous when visiting her Instagram account. One of the Instagram bio tips Queen Latifah teaches us is that you can learn a lot about a person even from a short bio for Instagram.</string>
